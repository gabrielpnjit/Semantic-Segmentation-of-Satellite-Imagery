# BOHO Hyperparameter Optimization on The Semantic Segmentation

## What is BOHO?
>BOHO is the combination of the bayesian optimization and hyperband optimization, and the reason for the combination is 
> to gain the benefits both optimzations offer. The Bayesian optimization has the benefit of using prior knowledge since the
> bayesian works with data that is given while being very data efficient and another benefit is that is semi-paralleizable.
The Hyperband optimization has the benefits of being able to be easily parallelizable and it removes bad values, as well as including the 
>successive halving method which helps with the budgeting, so it keeps the best halves and keeps removing the worse halves, and continues
>for each iteration. When these two optimizations combine, they provide a stronger and better hyperparameter optimization algorithim which 
>makes it the most robust, flexible, and scalable.

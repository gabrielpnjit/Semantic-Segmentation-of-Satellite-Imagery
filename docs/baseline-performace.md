## Unet Explanation
>Unet is a common architechture for semantic segmentation. Unet helps identify and classify the image, and it classifies these as pixel-based classification. The Unet
>architecture follows an encoder network followed by a decoder network. What makes it special is that it projects different features it learns at different stages of the 
>encoder. The first half of the Unet deals with the encoder input image tiles, and different operations like capturing the contect of the image, are performed to get to the second half of the architechture. 
>The second half deals witht decoder which gives the output as a segmentation map.
